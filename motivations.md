I started off in IT and was working in a Helpdesk type role. It was very unrewarding on a day to day basis and I felt as though I was doing way more work than what should be required of me. My fiance changed her career from originally having an English degree and she went into coding and is very happy with her work now. I see that and I feel like I can do the same thing, I need to get into something else so I can feel appreciation and fulfilled.
